# Algorithms Against Humanity
Algorithms Against Humanity (a.k.a. AAH) is my custom Cards Against Humanity spinoff that uses the power of Websockets and Markov Chains.
This version also implements rooms and bots for both singleplayer and multiplayer needs.

## Requirements
1. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Usage
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/Zetta56/AAH.git` in your desired folder destination.
2. Run `npm run build` in the client directory to build the client
3. Run `node server.js` in the root directory to start the app

## Development
Instead of building the client, you can run `npm run serve` to start the Vue development server.
